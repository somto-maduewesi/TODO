py -m venv nameOfEvironment - To Creat a virtual environment
nameOfEvironment/Scripts/activate - To activate the virtual environment

py manage.py runserver - To run The Project Server
py manage.py startapp appName - To start an App in our Project
py manage.py createsuperuser - To create a super user/admin for our app

After creating an app 'appName', you have to register it so you can see any page created in that app; so the app can be viewable. You register by adding the name of your app to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py (eg. INSTALLED_APPS = [
    '...',
    '...',
    # My Apps
    'appName',
])

if your creating a view always take in a request, and return a http response(html).

TO LOAD BOOTSTRAP 5 INTO YOUR DJANGO PROJECT:
- Activate your virtual environment.
- Install Bootstrap: pip install django-bootstrap-v5
- Add 'bootstrap5', to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
- Insert {% load bootstrap5 %}, {% bootstrap_css %}, and {% bootstrap_javascript %} into the head section of your template html.
    The first line tells Django that it should load the Bootstrap 5 module in this template.
    The second line inserts the <link> element with the referral to the bootstrap stylesheet.
    The third line inserts the <script> element with the referral to the necessary javascript file.
DONE!
